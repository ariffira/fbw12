                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead">This is the latest story in our Coronavirus Update series, in which Harvard specialists
                    in epidemiology, infectious disease, economics, politics, and other disciplines offer insights into
                    what the latest developments in the COVID-19 outbreak may bring.</p>

                <p>Turns out Mom was right. Health experts say the best, simplest ways to prevent the spread of
                    COVID-19, the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 3,200 people and affected more than
                    100,000 around the world, follow the tried and true cold-season admonishments given out for
                    generations. Wash your hands. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Avoid touching
                    your face. Stay home if you are sick.</p>

                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Eos, doloribus, dolorem iusto blanditiis
                    unde
                    eius illum consequuntur neque dicta incidunt ullam ea hic porro optio ratione repellat perspiciatis.
                    Enim, iure!
                    <br>
                    But some of the advice has gotten a little more specific.</p>

                <p>COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets, which typically travel about three to six feet and
                    settle on surfaces, where they can live for a few hours up to several days, according to the World
                    Health Organization. There is a risk of catching the disease by inhaling those particles, but there
                    is a more significant risk of getting it by touching surfaces, such as desks, handrails, or
                    doorknobs, where those droplets may have settled.</p>

                <p>“The disease transmission goes from a cough or sneeze to a surface to your hand to your face, and
                    that’s how people get infected,” said Paul Biddinger, director of the Emergency Preparedness
                    Research, Evaluation, and Practice Program, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Good hand
                    washing really matters. If people cough or sneeze into their elbow, that limits the spread of
                    respiratory secretions. What all of us can do together is follow basic hygiene measures that will
                    actually slow the spread of disease in communities.”

                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p class="mb-0">“Most people don’t wash their hands very well. As silly as it sounds to go watch a
                        YouTube video on handwashing, people should do it to learn how to do it properly.”
                    </p>

                <p>Basic hygiene measures may seem obvious, but they are important. Washing hands with plain soap and
                    plain water kills viruses, but only if it’s done thoroughly and often. Hands should be scrubbed for
                    at least 20 seconds, the time it takes to sing the “Happy Birthday” song twice, to ensure germs
                    won’t be transferred to objects or spread from person to person.
                </p>

                <p>“Most people don’t wash their hands very well,” said Biddinger. “As silly as it sounds to go watch a
                    YouTube video on handwashing, people should do it to learn how to do it properly. Washing hands has
                    been clearly proved to decrease disease transmission and lower your chance of getting infected.”</p>

                <p>Hand sanitizers may be helpful, if they contain at least 60 percent alcohol, according to the Centers
                    for Disease Control and Prevention. But if your hands are dirty or greasy the sanitizer won’t work,
                    which is why the agency favors hand washing. A 2006 study found that hand washing can cut the risk
                    of respiratory infection by 16 percent and a 2008 study showed a 21 percent reduction.</p>

                <p>Experts acknowledge the hardest of the self-protective measures to follow is not touching one’s face.
                    A 2015 study that observed medical students at the University of New South Wales found that each of
                    them touched their face 23 times per hour on average.</p>

                <p>It’s important to avoid face touching because germs can get into the body through the eyes, nose, and
                    mouth. Contaminated hands can transfer the virus when people rub their eyes, scratch their noses, or
                    touch their mouths. “We all reflexively touch our face,” said Biddinger. “But trying to be more
                    mindful of touching our face decreases our chance of infection.”</p>

                <p>The importance of following basic hygiene measures was highlighted by Mark Lipsitch, professor of
                    epidemiology at the Harvard Chan School and director of the Center for Communicable Disease
                    Dynamics.</p>

                <p>“Slowing the epidemic is what we have to do if we can’t stop it,” Lipsitch said in a Facebook Live
                    event on Monday sponsored by the Forum at Harvard Chan School and PRI’s “The World.”</p>

                <p>“All those measures, small as some of they may be, help to slow the epidemic. There is a real
                    coalescence between individually self-protective measures and measures that will benefit the
                    community. Basic hygiene and self-protection measures are in fact socially beneficial.”</p>

                <p>In the U.S., the coronavirus death toll rose to 12, and according to the Centers for Disease Control
                    and Prevention, and the number of reported COVID-19 cases climbed to 148 across 13 states as of
                    March 5. The New York Times reported 163 cases in 18 states.</p>

                <p>The World Health Organization said Tuesday that the new coronavirus is deadlier than the common flu,
                    with a mortality rate of 3.4 percent. Seasonal flu kills fewer than 1 percent of those infected.</p>

                <p>As the number of new cases outside China surges, concerns of a global pandemic are also rising.
                    According to a March 4 report by the World Health Organization, there were only 120 new cases in
                    China in the previous 24 hours, while 2,223 new cases were reported around the world. Eighty percent
                    of the cases outside China were reported in South Korea, Italy, and Iran.</p>

                <p>Health experts expect to see more coronavirus cases in New England, Massachusetts, and the Boston
                    area, but Biddinger reminded the public to consult reputable information sites, such as the CDC or
                    the Massachusetts Department of Health, to quell unfounded fears.</p>

                <p>“Fear is not productive, and fear doesn’t protect you from illness in any way,” said Biddinger. “I
                    encourage people to avoid the tremendous amount of misinformation that is out there on different
                    social media sites. People need to get good information because being informed decreases fear, and
                    they need to take basic hygiene measures that protect them. And even though those measures don’t
                    sound very exciting, they are absolutely proved, by the data, to protect your health.”</p>
