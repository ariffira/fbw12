                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p>Staying at home during quarantine is a must for one’s own health and the safety of the entire
                    community. To spend a day or two without going out is often very pleasurable: having a good sleep
                    and staying in a cozy place is so much recreational. Yet, a week or two at home may seem exhausting
                    and feel like torture. At first glance, it suggests nothing interesting but apart from boredom and
                    binge Netflix there are lots of interesting and useful activities one can do to stay active and
                    happy during the quarantine.</p>

                <h3>Self-development</h3>

                <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images/developmnetself.jpg" alt="Self-development" class="rounded">

                <p>Quarantine and social distancing are a perfect occasion to spend some time on education and personal
                    growth. With the internet and a laptop, or a smartphone it is super-easy to learn and have fun
                    during the process. Here are some of the good educational resources to try out:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>. Always wanted to learn calculus, or
                        maybe chemistry, or macroeconomics? This platform offers numerous STEM courses for free without
                        any limitations.</li>

                    <li><a href="https://en.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>. If you dreamed about learning French but never
                        had enough time to start, now you have a good opportunity. The service offers courses in
                        numerous languages, so why not start speaking Japanese today?</li>

                        courses from pet care to investment and trading.</li>

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Communication</h3>

                <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images/comunication.jpg" alt="comunication" class="rounded">

                <p>Self-isolation is very challenging in terms of a lack of communication with close people. But modern
                    technologies allow people to stay connected 24/7 via messengers, video chats and phone calls. Talk
                    to your family and friends every day. Post your fun indoor activities on Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok
                    or Facebook and get positive emotions from communication. Do not forget to FaceTime your friends who
                    leave abroad. Quarantine is a good reminder that we forget how communication is important in our
                    lives and how important it is to stay in touch and support each other during these hard times.</p>

                <h3>Art</h3>

                <p>Painting, drawing, origami, making clay figurines, are all fun and meditating. There are thousands of
                    DIY videos on the internet you can try. Apart from relaxing and developing creativity art can also
                    be useful. For example, staying at home and entertaining yourself you can:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Learn Photoshop.</strong> Make your pictures stunning and impress your Instagram
                        subscribers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare your next Halloween costume.</strong> Be a star on the next Halloween party with
                        your handmade costume: you can make a mask for yourself, decorate some old clothes or let your
                        creativity out and come up with something unimaginable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decorate your home.</strong> Your walls seem empty? Master graphics and add color to
                        your surroundings.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Sports</h3>

                <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images/sport.jpg" alt="sport" class="rounded">

                <p>Keeping fit without the possibility to go out is actually not a problem. On YouTube and Instagram,
                    one can find thousands of videos on how to workout at home. You don’t have any equipment at home?
                    It’s okay. For example, dumbbells can be substituted with water bottles. All you need is some space
                    and a good mood. It is important to keep fit and be active. Also, exercises are good for relieving
                    stress and negative thoughts. Turn on some favorite tunes and shake it off!</p>

                <h3>Mental health</h3>

                <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images/mental health.jpg" alt="sport" class="rounded">

                <p>It is not easy to control oneself and manage stress in the face of uncertainty and danger so it is
                    important to stay calm and take care of one’s mental health. One of the things that trigger the
                    anxiety the most is bad or fake news. Try to avoid reading too much especially on social media.
                    Trust only reliable sources such as quality papers and statements made by the government. Another
                    crucial thing is to get away from all the bad information, which can be achieved by:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Yoga</li>
                    <li>Meditation</li>
                    <li>Daydreaming</li>
                    <li>Listening to music</li>
                    <li>Talking to family and friends</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cooking</h3>

                <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images/cooking.jpg" alt="cooking" class="rounded">

                <p>During the quarantine, people are at risk of gaining weight since food is available all the time and
                    boredom often temps to eat something tasty. Try to level up your cooking skills and challenge
                    yourself to prepare tasty but low-calorie food. You can bet with your friends on the most beautiful
                    food pics on Instagram. Try new recipes, experiment, enjoy your food and be proud of yourself as a
                    cook!</p>

                <h3>Developing good habits</h3>

                <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images/habits.jpg" alt="habits" class="rounded">

                <p>If you often go to bed late, now you can correct your lifestyle and daily routine. Try planning your
                    week and keep with the plan. Start making your bed immediately after waking up, use the dental floss
                    after eating and bit by bit achieve all the good habits you wanted to. Possible areas of improvement
                    are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Daily routine</li>
                    <li>Keeping your place in order</li>
                    <li>Skincare routine</li>
                    <li>Budget planning</li>
                    <li>Healthy diet</li>
                    <li>Physical training</li>
                    <li>Control over the time spent on social media</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Beauty and wellness</h3>

                <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images/wellness.jpg" alt="wellness" class="rounded">

                <p>Having enough sleep and rest positively influences skin condition. But you can make your natural look
                    even better with expanded skincare routine. Masks, scrubs, and creams can nourish, purify and
                    brighten your skin. If you feel you are too lazy for this, there is a trick: before going to bed
                    wash your face and put toner and cream on your bedside table to apply them immediately before
                    sleeping.</p>

                <p>Do not forget about your hair too. A good idea is to start practicing scalp massage to boost growth
                    and shine. Applying hair masks once or twice a week will also make your hair more hydrated,
                    protected, and silky.</p>

                <p>Prepare for the end of the quarantine – when it is over you will walk outside and shine with beauty
                    and health.
                </p>

                <h3>Movies</h3>

                <p>People often postpone doing home chores due to lack of time or energy but quarantine presupposes
                    plenty of both of them. Clean the house and put everything in the order: drawers, bookshelves,
                    kitchenware. What some videos on YouTube on how to organize space effectively. You will love your
                    comfy and clean home. It is high time to apply Marie Kondo’s method and organize your wardrobe,
                    kitchen, living room, and so on.</p>

                <h3>Online Shopping</h3>

                    clothes or anything else have fun reading all the reviews, check the ingredients, dig deep in the
                    sales section. Be discerning and capricious – choose the best deals and the highest quality
                    products. When shopping for clothes, unleash your inner designer: check your wardrobe, look for the

                <p>One of the best cures from boredom is a new experience. Try new activities, cook new food, watch
                    movies and listen to music you would typically avoid. Maybe deep inside you, there is a huge talent
                    for writing or making comics, beauty guru or a dancer. By engaging in new activities you also learn
                    about yourself and realize what is interesting for you.</p>

                    longer feel like torture. Do the things you enjoy and the time will pass smoothly and fun.</p>
